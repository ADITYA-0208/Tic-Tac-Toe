Java, JavaFX
As a software developer with a passion for creating engaging user experiences, I recently undertook a project to develop an interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game powered by AI. As the sole developer on the project, I designed and implemented the game from scratch, using advanced algorithms to create a truly challenging and engaging experience for players of all skill levels.

My Tic-Tac-Toe game leverages the power of artificial intelligence to provide players with a unique and exciting gaming experience. By incorporating machine learning algorithms, my game is able to adapt to the player's style and level of play, creating a more challenging and personalized gaming experience.

Whether you're a beginner looking to learn the basics of the game or a seasoned player seeking a true challenge, my Tic-Tac-Toe game is sure to provide hours of entertainment. So why not give it a try and see how your skills stack up against the power of AI?
